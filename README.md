## Description

The platform primarily includes features such as video interviews and collaborative code editing. The system uses Conflict-Free Replication Data Types (CRDT) to address the collaborative editing problem between interviewers and candidates. It uses WebRTC technology to implement video interview functionality and the Monaco Editor for code editing.

The implementation of this system greatly enhances the convenience and accuracy of interviews for web front-end developer positions, thereby increasing the efficiency of hiring employees for enterprises and organizations and improving employee suitability.
